  - **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Streamlines administrative tasks related to managing players, teams, tournaments, and communication.
- **Expected Outcomes:**
  - Increased player and coach engagement with club activities.
  - Significant reduction in administrative time spent on tournament and player management.
  - Improved accuracy and consistency of sports data.
  - Enhanced communication and transparency within the club.
  - A more professional and organized image for the sports club.

  7.  **Match Updates:** During the match, the user receives push notifications and in-app notifications about score updates (if updates are available).
  8.  **Post-Match:** User views detailed match results and statistics.
  9.  **News:** User reads any related news articles about the match or tournament.
  10. **Profile Review:** User reviews their updated statistics and ranking.

  - SQL injection.
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Other common web vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing (at least annually) to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Implement CSRF protection using a library like `csurf`.
- **HTTP Security Headers:** Implement appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`) to enhance security.

**7. Performance & Scalability**

- **Performance Benchmarks:** (As defined before - page loads < 2s, API responses < 300ms).
- **Scalability Plans:**
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the application to be horizontally scalable from the start. This means using stateless API servers (Node.js/Express) that can be easily replicated behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).
  - **Database Scaling:**
    - **Read Replicas:** Use MongoDB read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database server.
    - **Sharding:** Consider database sharding (partitioning) if the data volume grows extremely large. This is a more complex solution and may not be necessary initially.
    - **Connection Pooling:** Implement connection pooling on the backend.
  - **Caching:**
    - **Redis:** Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., tournament standings, player profiles, news articles). This reduces database load and improves response times.
    - **HTTP Caching:** Use appropriate HTTP caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`) to allow browsers and CDNs to cache static assets and API responses.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use Cloudflare as a CDN to serve static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) from edge locations closer to users, improving performance and reducing server load.

**8. Testing & QA Plan**

- **Testing Strategy**
  - **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and components in isolation using Jest or Mocha.
  - **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different modules and services.
  - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the entire application workflow from start to finish (using tools like Cypress or Playwright).
  - **Performance Tests:** Load testing and stress testing to ensure the application can handle expected traffic.
  - **Security Tests:** Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
  - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing by real users to validate that the application meets their needs.
- **QA Workflows:**
  - **Bug Tracking:** Use Jira for tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
  - **Code Reviews:** _All_ code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch. Use a pull request (PR) workflow.
  - **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, and E2E) into the CI/CD pipeline. Any code changes that break tests should not be deployed.
  - **Dedicated QA Team:** Ideally, have a dedicated QA team or individual responsible for manual testing and ensuring overall quality.
  - **Test Environments:** Use separate environments for development, staging (testing), and production.

**9. Deployment & Maintenance**

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Use a CI/CD tool (Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or similar) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
  - Automated deployments to staging and production environments.
- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalable and reliable deployments.
  - Cloud-based deployment (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
- **Maintenance Workflows:**
  - **Error Monitoring:** Use a monitoring tool (Sentry, New Relic, or similar) to track errors and performance issues.
  - **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to help with debugging and troubleshooting.
  - **Version Updates:** Regularly update dependencies and libraries to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
  - **Database Backups:** Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss.
  - **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Have a plan in place to recover from major outages.

This PRD provides a comprehensive starting point for developing the SportsRoz application. Further details and refinements would be needed as the project progresses, based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
